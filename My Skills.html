            <h1>Hobby</h1>
            <img src="/assets/images/profile_pic.png" alt="">
            <p>I have only one hobby right now and that is Coding. When I was in Standard 8, I had another hobby and that was painting and sketching, but, I left that hobby.</p>

            <h1>WHY DID I STARTED CODING?</h1>
            <img src="/assets/images/profile_pic.png" alt="">
            <p>I started to code because, one day I was feeling so lonely and therefore I decided to learn HTML for timepass and that was the start. Slowly, interest started to develop in programming and I started to learn different programming languages. I know that I am not very perfect with my coding skills, but still it's okay because I learnt everything on my own with the help of internet. So, yeah my loneliness was the reason why I started to learn coding and now I am loving it. However, nowadays I am not very lonely.
